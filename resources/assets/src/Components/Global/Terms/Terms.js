				<h2>TICKET DISCLAIMERS</h2>
				<h4>STANDARD TICKETS</h4>
				<p>Our policy objective is to ensure a healthy ratio of Enterprise to Vendor delegates at all our events. This ensures that representatives of Enterprise organizations are not overwhelmed by Vendor organizations. It assists in the protection of investments made by the Sponsors, Exhibitors and Partners at UNLEASH events. To achieve this, we enforce a strict policy of approvals with quota limits. It should be noted that we reserve the right to refuse ticket(s) to representatives of vendor companies (software/services/solution providers) and consultants of any kind who register themselves in this way.</p>
				<h2>Cancellation Policy & Replacements for Standard Tickets:</h2>
				<h4>PLEASE NOTE:</h4>
				<p>Cancellation (No Show and No Replacement): Credit Vouchers are made available to the value of the ticket amount invested, valid for the upcoming event on the same continent. A written cancellation by email to HRN Europe is required and must be sent at least one (1) week prior to the event. If a written cancellation is received less than one week before the event, no full or partial refunds will be provided, and no Credit Vouchers will be issued. Authorized/invoiced registrations are strictly enforceable and deemed 100% payable on receipt. For Loyalty Members Credit Vouchers are issued based on their package conditions.</p>
				<p>Replacement (substitution / name change): If you are unable to attend the event, you may elect to send a Senior Leadership representative in your place at no additional cost.
